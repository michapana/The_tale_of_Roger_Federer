# The tale of Roger Federer

This is a data project aiming to demonstrate my skills in managing and visualizing data through storytelling. 

Roger Federer is a 37 year old Swiss professional tennis player, currently ranked No.3 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).
Though this analysis, the aim is to:
- Understand his career progression through visualising some of his background; who is Roger Federer?
- Compare Federer's playing style through the years; examine his key playing weapons
- Model the probability of him winning a match based on his latest performance

**Can he keep his best any longer?**
